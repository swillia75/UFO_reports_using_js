# javascript_challenge

We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)


Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided (we recommend building your own custom page!).


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.



Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
